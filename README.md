<h2> Business Problem:</h2> 
There is no clear indication of what contributes to successful dynamic pricing in ride shares / public vehicular transportation.
Customers might be interested in understanding the determinants of dynamic pricing so that they have better understanding of their commute options. <br>

Competitors (other ride share or taxi companies) may want to optimize their pricing through machine learning.<br>
  
<h2>Solution:</h2> 
Through predictive modeling, Our team attempts to identify the important attributes that determine pricing/surges of Uber& Lyft rides. <br> <br>
  
Programming Language: R  <br>
Predictive Analytics Models:  Linear Regression, LASSO Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Model <br>
